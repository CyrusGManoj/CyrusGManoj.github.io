I am a computer science student at CSUF. I expect to graduate in 2025. I love dogs and hate bananas. 

# A list of my favorite CPSC 120 Labs.
* Lab 10

What I liked about Lab 10 was that I could work with real-world information about California.
Breaking down the problem into smaller functions made the code more organized and fun to write.
I was also able to understand my capabilities in code, in this solo lab. 


* Lab 7

In this lab, we worked with parking regulations, and translating parking rules into code was pretty fun.
Each street had different rules, allowing us to write specific code for each unique scenario.
This code had more real-world application and since there were different rules to adhere to, there were different errors that popped up.
Getting that green tick after completing this lab was very satisfying. 


* Lab 8, Part-2

I enjoyed working on part 2 of this lab. 
In this lab, we were presented with a very visually appealing pattern at the end of it which felt satisfying. 
On top of that, we were able to better understand the importance of loop structures and how they function in this lab.
